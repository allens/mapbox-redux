# I hate modern JS - Boilerplate

This is a f***ing boilerplate with all the new JS features, new?, new as new JS fatigue allows...

Her you will found:

* Webpack 4, of course, now you can't do nothing without this tool
* Babel, integrated with Webpack. To translate the transpilation of the translation to whatever
* eslint, please, keep your code ordered, even your code is a f***king shit!
* Jest, to testing, nothing more to say.

How to use:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/michogar/i-hate-modern-js.git
$ mv i-hate-modern-js your-f***king-project-name
$ cd your-f***king-project-name
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
